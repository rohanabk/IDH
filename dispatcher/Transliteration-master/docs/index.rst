Welcome to transliteration's documentation!
===========================================

Transliterator This application helps you to transliterate text from
any Indian language to any other Indian language. Enter the text for
transliteration in the below text area. Language of each word will
be detected.

You can give the text in any language and even with
mixed language. For Malayalam alone, English->Malayalam,
Malayalam->English Transliteration is available.  ISO 15919, an
international standard for the transliteration of Indic scripts to
the Latin alphabet formed in 2001 is also supported. Select ISO
15919:2001 for 'Transliterate To' for using this scheme.
Transliteration to International Phonetic Alphabet is also
available.
